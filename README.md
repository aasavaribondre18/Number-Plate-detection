# Number Plate Detection ðŸš—ðŸ“·

A computer vision project to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or live video feeds using Python and OpenCV (or YOLO, EasyOCR, etc.).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To develop a robust number plate detection system that can:
- Detect number plates from images or real-time video.
- Extract and recognize alphanumeric characters from the plate.
- Output the recognized number plate for logging or further processing.
